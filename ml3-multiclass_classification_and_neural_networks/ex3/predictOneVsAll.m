function p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label for a trained one-vs-all classifier. The labels
%are in the range 1..K, where K = size(all_theta, 1).
%  p = PREDICTONEVSALL(all_theta, X) will return a vector of predictions
%  for each example in the matrix X. Note that X contains the examples in
%  rows. all_theta is a matrix where the i-th row is a trained logistic
%  regression theta vector for the i-th class. You should set p to a vector
%  of values from 1..K (e.g., p = [1; 3; 1; 2] predicts classes 1, 3, 1, 2
%  for 4 examples)

m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(all_theta, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% Add ones to the X data matrix
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions:
% {{{
% Complete the following code to make predictions using your learned logistic
% regression parameters (one-vs-all).  You should set p to a vector of
% predictions (from 1 to num_labels).
%
% Hint: This code can be done all vectorized using the max function.
%       In particular, the max function can also return the index of the
%       max element, for more information see 'help max'. If your examples
%       are in rows, then, you can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max
%       for each row.
% }}}

% Tips:
% {{{
% The code you add to predictOneVsAll.m can be as little as two lines:
%
% 1. one line to calculate the sigmoid() of the product of X and all_theta. X
%    is (m x n), and all_theta is (num_labels x n), so you'll need a
%    transposition to get a result of (m x num_labels)
%
% 2. one line to return the classifier which
%    has the max value. The size will be (m x 1). Use the "help max" command in
%    your workspace to learn how the max() function returns two values.
%
% Note that your function must return the predictions as a column vector - size
% (m x 1). If you return a row vector, the script will not compute the accuracy
% correctly
% }}}

h      = sigmoid(X * all_theta');  % predictions
[~, p] = max(h, [], 2);            % p is the index of the max value of each row of h

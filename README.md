# What is this?

This repo contains my homework of assignment in [Stanford Machine Learning Class](http://www.ml-class.org).
If you are taking the class please fork the project and put different solutions in a different branch. However please do not post any code before the due date (homework is due every sunday) and do not post any code in my repo according to "Stanford Honer Code" below.

Most comments in code come from Tom Mosher, an excellent mentor.

## Stanford Honor Code

> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups,  and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However,  the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises,  you are welcome to discuss them with other students,  discuss specific algorithms,  properties of algorithms,  etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student,  nor show your solution code to other students."

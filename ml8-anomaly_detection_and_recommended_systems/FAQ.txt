Q1) I get the correct results for the collaborative filtering exercise, but I don't get any points from the submit grader. Why?

The tutorial for this exercise (via the Resources menu) tells about a characteristic of the submit grader's test case which your cofiCostFunc() code must cope with.

Q2) Why are some of the movie recommendations greater than 5?

There is an error in ex8_cofi.m. See the tutorial for this exercise (from the Resources menu) to learn how to fix it.
